# Commusify-2.0

Commusify - A music service truly connected to it's community.

## About

Originally, this idea came via a school project (see [original repo](https://github.com/jzelAdmin2006/Commusify)). Now the whole thing should become a longer term project independent from the school, where everything is more thought through (in the original project there was extremely high time pressure and the focus was almost only on the object orientation, neglecting everything else).

## Architecture

- Backend: Java (Spring)
- Frontend: Vue / Angular (TBD), Electron, TypeScript
- Web Server: TBD
- Database: Postgres (provider TBD, probably same as web server)
